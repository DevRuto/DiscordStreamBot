# Discord Stream Bot

## C# Blazor Server project

> Announces when a streamer goes live on Twitch

## Why D#+ Over Discord.Net?
Within the Discord.API discord, it's sounding like the owner of the Discord.Net project has been MIA for some time so updates are unlikely for now, and the package would break when Discord releases breaking API changes.

## Configurations

- Twitch/Discord configurations in `DiscordStreamBot/appsettings.json`
- Logging configuratoins in `DiscordStreamBot/appsettings.json`
- Embed Format in `DiscordStreamBot/Discord/EmbedService.cs`
